branches can just be numbers on servers, which improves anonymity.

branch can point to its parent group and to its host.

profiles can be based on the id public key. probably a shorter hash of it?

basic idea is to pin the pages and let the ui thread read the pages directly?
this might be hard to do with optimistic latching. It's probably better to send the slice to the ui and let it diff it with tupleids.

so if the watcher is triggered, it requeries and sends the data to interested clients.

admin creates a revoke/grant command, signs it, creates a new publishing key, winds the reader key, then publishes the new reader key.

how do you revoke an admin? problem, admin already knows the winding key, so that needs to be replaced. In this case we need to create a new winding key and include both keys, drop extra key when lazy encryption is complete.

we could create admin sets, then the admin sets would could reuse their key setup on multiple branches.
the problem with this is that most branches have unique admin sets! roughly a DM + friends on both sides of the dm.



// since shared is just to support multiple tabs, maybe we can launch directly to make it easier to debug?

//const worker = sharedWorker(new URL('./shared', import.meta.url))
// await worker.ask('ping').then(e => {
//     console.log("adferw", e)
// })

// try one worker for debugging, not shared. gives us opfs.

/* 
    // with one tab, there is just this one client
    cl = new Client(async (r: Rpc): Promise<any> =>{ 
        switch(r.method) {
            default: 
                return 0
        }
    }) 

        async ask(method: string , params?: any) : Promise<any>{
        const o =  await this.cl.dispatch( {
            method,
            id: 42,
            params
        })

// prosemirror keeps two copies: predicted and golden; it throws away predicted when new transactions come in.
// transactions are steps that can be rebased. we need to hang on to the transaction until its resolved
// insert doesn't need to changing, delete doesn't need changing. update = delete + f(old, delta)


// each db is completely isolated.
// can dgos can update the database when the iframe is not loaded?
// might as well just load the iframe and let the code itself churn.
