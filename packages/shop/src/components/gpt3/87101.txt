If a doctor suspects that someone has a skin infection from fungi, they may order a skin fungi culture. This is a test to see if there are any fungi present in a small sample of skin. The sample is taken from the affected area of skin and then sent to a laboratory. If there are any fungi present in the skin sample, they will grow in the laboratory and can be identified.
