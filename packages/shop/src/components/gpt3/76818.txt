This is a test that is used to check on the health of a baby while it is still in the womb. The test uses two methods to assess the baby's health - the biophysical profile and the non-stress test. The biophysical profile measures things like the baby's heart rate, movement, and breathing. The non-stress test monitors the baby's heart rate in response to movement.
