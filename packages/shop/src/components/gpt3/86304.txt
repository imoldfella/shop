A blood test to monitor for cancer would check your blood for the presence of a protein that is produced by some types of cancer cells. This protein, called CA 125, can be found in higher levels in the blood of some people who have cancer. The test results can help your doctor determine if you have cancer, and if so, what type it might be.
