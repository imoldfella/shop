A colonoscopy is a test where a doctor uses an endoscope (a long, thin tube with a camera on the end) to look inside your large intestine (also called the colon). They do this to check for any abnormal growths or bleeding. During a colonoscopy, the doctor may also take a small tissue sample (biopsy) from the colon for further testing.
