A CT (computed tomography) scan is a special kind of X-ray that allows doctors to see inside your body. For this particular CT scan, the doctor will take X-rays of your abdomen (belly) and pelvis (hip area) from more than one angle. The CT scan is done with and without contrast material. Contrast material is a dye that helps certain areas show up better on the X-ray.
