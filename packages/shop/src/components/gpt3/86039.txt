Your body has cells that protect it from infection, called antibodies. Sometimes, your body makes antibodies against itself by mistake. This can happen if you have an autoimmune disease, where your body's immune system attacks healthy cells by mistake.

The ANA test is a blood test that measures the level of these antibodies in your blood. If the level is high, it may mean that you have an autoimmune disease.
