A CT is like an x-ray, but it gives a more detailed image. CT stands for computed tomography. The machine takes pictures of your insides from different angles. These pictures are then put together by a computer to give a clear image of the area being studied. The test is used to look at the abdomen and pelvis. The pictures are taken without dye because the doctor wants to see the area without any color.
