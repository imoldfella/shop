A colonoscopy is a test that doctors use to check for colon cancer. They put a long, thin tube with a tiny camera on the end into the person's rectum and then guide it up into the colon. During the procedure, the doctor may remove small tissue samples (biopsies) to be checked for cancer. The test is considered "not high risk" if the person does not have any symptoms or family history of colon cancer.
