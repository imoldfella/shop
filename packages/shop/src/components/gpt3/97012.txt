Decompression therapy is a treatment that is used to help relieve pain in the spine. The spine is a column of bones in the back that support the body. The spinal cord runs through the spine and carries messages between the brain and the rest of the body.

In decompression therapy, a machine is used to apply a gentle traction force to the spine. This force stretches the spine and takes pressure off of the spinal cord and the nerves. This can help to relieve pain and improve function.
