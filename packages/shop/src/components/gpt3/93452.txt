A cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in heart health. A cardiac catheterization is a test that is sometimes used to diagnose heart conditions. It involves inserting a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into the heart through a small incision in the chest. Once the catheter is in place, the doctor can do tests to see how well the heart is working.
