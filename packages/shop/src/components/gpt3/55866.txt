Prostate surgery is when the doctor removes the prostate gland and the nearby lymph nodes. This is done using an endoscope, which is a long, thin tube with a camera on the end. The endoscope goes into the body through a small cut in the skin. The camera lets the doctor see the prostate gland and the nearby lymph nodes. The doctor then removes the prostate gland and the lymph nodes.
