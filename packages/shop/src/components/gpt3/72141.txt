An MRI is a machine that uses strong magnets and radio waves to take pictures of the inside of your body. Usually, when you have an MRI, you have to lie still inside the machine for about 30 minutes while it takes the pictures. An MRI of the neck or spine without dye means that the machine will take pictures of your neck or spine without using any dye.
