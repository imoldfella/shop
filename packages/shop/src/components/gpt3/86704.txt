The 'Hep B Core Antibody Total' blood test is used to check for the presence of antibodies to the hepatitis B virus. These antibodies are produced by the body in response to an infection with the hepatitis B virus. The test can be used to determine if a person has been infected with the virus in the past, or if they are currently infected.
