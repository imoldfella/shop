In order for doctors to see a person's brain stem, they need to do an MRI scan. This is a scan of the brain that uses magnetic waves and does not involve any x-rays. The MRI machine can take pictures of the brain stem before and after the person has been injected with a special dye. This dye helps the doctors to see the brain stem more clearly.
