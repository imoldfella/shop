An ultrasound of the abdomen is a test that uses sound waves to create a picture of the inside of the abdomen (belly). The test is used to look for problems with the abdominal organs, such as the liver, gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas. The test is also used to look at the blood vessels in the abdomen.
