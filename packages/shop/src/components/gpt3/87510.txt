A blood test for vaginitis is a test to determine if there is an infection present in the vagina. It is often used to diagnose or rule out bacterial vaginosis, Candida vaginitis, or other types of infections. The test is performed by taking a sample of blood and then testing it for the presence of specific antibodies or other markers that indicate an infection.
