Mental disorders are illnesses that can make it hard for a person to think, feel, and behave normally. Seizures are sudden, uncontrolled electrical impulses that happen in the brain. During electric current therapy, doctors use electricity to trigger a seizure in the brain. This can provide relief from mental disorders for some people.
