The doctor is talking to the patient about having a colonoscopy screening done. This is a procedure where the doctor looks inside the colon (large intestine) for polyps or cancer. The doctor will do a physical exam and ask questions about the patient's medical history. The doctor may also order tests, such as a blood test or CT scan.
