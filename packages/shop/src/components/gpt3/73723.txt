A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine is a large machine that uses strong magnets and radio waves to take pictures inside your body. Doctors use MRIs to look at your bones and joints.

The machine will take pictures of your lower extremity (knee or ankle) joint with and without dye. The dye helps doctors to see the pictures more clearly.
