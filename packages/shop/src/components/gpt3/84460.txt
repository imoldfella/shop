A blood test is when a doctor takes a sample of your blood to test it in a lab. The '84460 ALANINE AMINO (ALT) (SGPT)' test is a liver function test. The liver is a big organ in your body that helps to filter blood. This test is looking at a specific protein, called Alanine Amino, to see how well the liver is working.
