A person's lung capacity is how much air they can breathe in and out. The higher the lung capacity, the more air you can breathe out. A person's ability to diffuse gases across their lung surfaces is how well they can move oxygen and carbon dioxide in and out of their lungs. The better a person can diffuse gases, the higher their lung capacity will be.
