A glucose tolerance test is a way to test if someone is likely to get gestational diabetes. During the test, a health care provider will take a person's blood sugar levels before and after they drink a sugary drink. If the person's blood sugar levels are high after drinking the sugary drink, it may mean that they are at risk for gestational diabetes.
