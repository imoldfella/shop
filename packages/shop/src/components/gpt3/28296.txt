A hallux valgus is a condition that affects the bones, ligaments, and tendons of the foot. The bones in the foot are not properly aligned, which can cause pain and difficulty walking. The ligaments and tendons are also affected, which can make it difficult to move the foot. Surgery is typically required to correct the problem.
