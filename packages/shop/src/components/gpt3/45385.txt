A colonoscopy is a medical procedure used to look at the large intestine (also called the colon). A long, flexible, lighted tube (called an endoscope) is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. The doctor is able to see the inside of the colon and look for any abnormal growths (such as polyps or tumors). The doctor may also remove any growths that are found during the colonoscopy.
