Acupuncture is a technique that involves sticking thin needles into the skin at specific points on the body. It is used to help relieve pain or treat other conditions.

With stimulation, this means that the needles will be connected to a device that gives them a small electrical current. This is done to help increase the effectiveness of the acupuncture.
