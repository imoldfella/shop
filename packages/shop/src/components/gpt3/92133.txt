Your eyes are sensory organs that allow you to see by detecting and processing light stimuli. Images are formed when light enters the eyes and is focused on the retina, a thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye that is lined with light-sensitive cells called photoreceptors. These photoreceptors convert the light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the optic nerve.

Optic nerve imaging is a type of medical imaging test that uses specialized imaging equipment to create pictures of the optic nerve, a bundle of nerve fibers that transmits information from the eye to the brain. This type of imaging can be used to diagnose conditions that affect the optic nerve, such as glaucoma, and to monitor the progression of these conditions.
