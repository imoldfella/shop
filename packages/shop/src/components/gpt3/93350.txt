A stress test with echocardiogram is a test doctors perform to find out how well your heart works when it is under stress. To do the test, you will first exercise on a treadmill or bike. Then, you will have an ultrasound of your heart. The ultrasound will show how well your heart is working and if there are any areas of concern.
