There are lots of different ways that people can move their bodies, and sometimes people end up moving in patterns that are not very helpful or healthy. This can happen when people have an injury, or when they have a condition that makes it hard to move normally. Neuromuscular reeducation is a way for physical therapists to help people learn how to move their bodies in healthy patterns again.
