The 87210 SMEAR WET MOUNT SALINE/INK test is a lab test that is used to screen for evidence of vaginal infection. This test is usually done on women who have symptoms of vaginal infection, such as burning, itching, or discharge. The test is done by putting a sample of vaginal fluid on a slide and looking at it under a microscope. The doctor will look for things like bacteria, yeast, or trichomonas (a type of parasite). If any of these things are found, it may be an infection.
