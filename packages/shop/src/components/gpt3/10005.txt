A biopsy is when a doctor takes a small sample of tissue from the body to look at under a microscope. They may do this to check for cancer or other problems.

A fine needle biopsy means that the doctor uses a very thin needle to take the tissue sample.

An ultrasound is a test that uses sound waves to create a picture of the inside of the body. The doctor may use ultrasound to help them guide the needle to the right place to take the biopsy.

The first lesion means that this is the first time the doctor has taken a biopsy from this particular area.
