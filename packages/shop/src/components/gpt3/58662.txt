A surgeon will make a few small cuts in the patient's belly. Then, the surgeon will put a long, thin tube called a laparoscope into the patient's belly. A camera on the end of the laparoscope will show the surgeon what's going on inside the patient's belly. The surgeon will also put other thin, metal tubes called instruments into the patient's belly through the same cuts. These instruments will help the surgeon remove the patient's ovaries, fallopian tubes, and other pelvic organs.
