The Epstein-Barr virus is a virus that is known to cause mononucleosis, which is also known as "mono." This virus is spread through contact with saliva, so it is often spread through kissing. The Epstein-Barr virus can also be spread through other close contact, such as sharing food or drinks. The Epstein-Barr virus can also be spread through blood, so it is important to be careful when around someone who has mono. The Epstein-Barr virus is most commonly found in young adults, but it can infect people of any age. The Epstein-Barr virus is not dangerous and most people who are infected will not have any symptoms. However, some people who are infected with the Epstein-Barr virus will develop mononucleosis. Mononucleosis is a sickness that can cause fever, sore throat, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. Mononucleosis can make it hard to eat or drink and can make you feel very tired. Most people who have mononucleosis will get better in a few weeks, but some people may feel sick for months.
