Incompetent veins are veins that are not functioning properly. They may be dilated, tortuous, or have incompetent valves. These veins can cause problems such as pain, swelling, skin ulcers, and blood clots. Laser removal of incompetent veins is a minimally-invasive procedure that uses heat from a laser to destroy the vein.
