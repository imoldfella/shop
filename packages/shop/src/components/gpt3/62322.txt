A person has a needle inserted into their lower back near the spine. They may be lying on their stomach or on their side. The area is numbed with medicine and then the needle is inserted into the space around the spine. Sometimes imaging is used to guide the needle into the right spot. Medication is then injected into the space around the spine. This is done to help manage pain.
