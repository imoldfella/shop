The gallbladder is a small sac under the liver that stores bile, which helps the body break down fats. Sometimes the gallbladder can become inflamed or full of stones, and when this happens it needs to be removed. This operation is called a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The surgeon will make a few small cuts in the abdomen and insert a tiny camera and other instruments through the cuts. The surgeon will then remove the gallbladder and methodically check the bile ducts for any stones that may have fallen into them.
