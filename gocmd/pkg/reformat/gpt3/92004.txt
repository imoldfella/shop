A 92004 eye exam is a type of medical exam that an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) does to check your eyes. They will do a series of tests to check your vision and eye health. This may include looking into your eyes with a bright light, checking your vision with an eye chart, and testing how well your eyes move. If the ophthalmologist finds any problems, they may start a treatment plan to help improve your vision or eye health.
