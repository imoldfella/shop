A colonoscopy is a procedure where a doctor inserts a long, thin tube into the rectum and colon in order to examine the inside of the large intestine. Sometimes, during the procedure, the doctor may need to control any bleeding that occurs in the large intestine. In order to do this, they will use an endoscope, which is a tool that allows them to see inside the intestine and stop any bleeding that is occurring.
