The fetal biophysical profile is a test that is usually done during the last few weeks of pregnancy. It is used to check on the baby's health. The test is done by putting a special kind of gel on the mother's stomach. This gel helps the doctor to see the baby's heart, movements, and breathing. The test takes about 30 minutes.
