Carpal tunnel surgery is a procedure to release the pressure on the median nerve in your wrist. The carpal tunnel is a small space in your wrist surrounded by bones and ligaments. The median nerve runs through the carpal tunnel and gives feeling to your thumb and first three fingers. When the transverse carpal ligament, one of the ligaments surrounding the carpal tunnel, is too tight, it puts pressure on the median nerve and causes carpal tunnel syndrome. In carpal tunnel surgery, the transverse carpal ligament is cut to relieve pressure on the median nerve and improve carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms.
