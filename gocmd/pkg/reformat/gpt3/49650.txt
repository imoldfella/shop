A hernia is when an organ or tissue sticks out through a hole in the muscle. An inguinal hernia is when this happens in the groin area. The surgery to fix it is called a laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. The doctor makes a tiny cut in the belly and then puts a thin, long tube with a camera on the end of it (laparoscope) into the belly. The camera shows the doctor what is going on inside. The doctor then does the surgery through the other tiny cuts.
