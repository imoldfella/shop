10021 FNA W/O IMAGE is a medical code used to describe a Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy without imaging. This means that a doctor has performed a biopsy (a medical procedure in which a small sample of tissue is removed from the body for examination) using a needle, but did not use any imaging (such as x-rays) to guide the needle.
