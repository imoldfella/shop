A "preventive medicine evaluation" is a checkup with a doctor to make sure you're healthy and to find out if there's anything you can do to stay healthy. The "99386" is a code that tells the insurance company what kind of visit this is. "New Age 40-64" means that this is for someone who is between the ages of 40 and 64 and who has never had this kind of visit before.
