During a hysteroscopy, a doctor inserts a small tube with a tiny camera on the end through the vagina and up into the uterus. This lets the doctor see inside the uterus and look for any problems. If the doctor sees anything abnormal, they may do a biopsy, which means taking a small sample of tissue for testing.
