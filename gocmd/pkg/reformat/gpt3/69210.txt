Ear wax is a yellowish, waxy substance that is produced by the glands in the ear. It helps to protect the ear from dirt and bacteria. Sometimes, ear wax can build up and become hard. This can cause it to become impacted, which means it is difficult to remove. In order to remove impacted ear wax, a doctor will use a small, curved instrument to gently break up the wax and then suction it out.
