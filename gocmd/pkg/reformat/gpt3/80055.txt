If you are pregnant, your obstetrician (doctor who specializes in pregnancy) may order a blood test panel to check on your health and the health of your baby. This panel may include tests to check your blood type and Rh factor, hemoglobin (iron) levels, and blood cell counts. The panel may also check for infections, such as HIV and hepatitis, and for sexually transmitted diseases.
