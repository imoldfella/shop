There are a few different ways that doctors can break up and remove kidney stones. One way is called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. This is when doctors use sound waves to break up the kidney stones from outside of the body. Another way is when the doctor puts a tube through the patient's back and into the kidney. Then the doctor uses a laser to break up the stones.
