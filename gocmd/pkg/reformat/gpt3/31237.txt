Surgical nasal/sinus endoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure used to examine the nasal cavity and sinuses. A small, flexible telescope is inserted through the nose and into the sinuses. This allows the doctor to see any areas of inflammation or blockage. Biopsy, polypectomy or debridement may be performed during the procedure if necessary.
