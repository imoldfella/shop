A ureteral stent is a thin tube that is inserted into the ureter (the tube that drains urine from the kidney to the bladder) to help relieve a blockage or obstruction. In some cases, the stent may be left in place for an extended period of time.

In this procedure, the stent is removed by cystoscopy, which is a minimally invasive procedure that uses a small camera to visualize the inside of the bladder and urethra. The camera is inserted through the urethra and into the bladder, and the stent is removed using small instruments.
