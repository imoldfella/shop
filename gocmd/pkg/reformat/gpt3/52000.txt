A cystoscopy is a medical procedure used to look at the inside of the bladder. A cystoscope, a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a camera, is inserted into the bladder through the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). The doctor can then see the inside of the bladder and look for any problems.
