Infected skin is skin that has been damaged by a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. Debriding is the process of removing infected skin. This usually involves cutting away the damaged skin with a sharp instrument, such as a scalpel. The area is then covered with a bandage to protect it from further infection.
