Carpal tunnel release is a type of surgery that helps to relieve pressure on the median nerve in your wrist. The carpal tunnel is a small space in your wrist that the median nerve and tendons travel through. When the tendons swell, they can put pressure on the median nerve and cause pain, weakness, and numbness in your hand and fingers.
