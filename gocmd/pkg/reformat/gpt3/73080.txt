A radiologic examination of the elbow is when a doctor or other medical professional uses X-rays to take a look at the elbow. This is usually done if there is something wrong with the elbow, such as pain or swelling. The doctor will take 3 or more pictures of the elbow from different angles to get a good look at it.
