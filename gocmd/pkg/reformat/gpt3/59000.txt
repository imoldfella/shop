When a woman is pregnant, her baby grows inside a sac of fluid called the amniotic sac. Sometimes, doctors need to take a sample of this fluid to test for certain conditions. This procedure is called amniocentesis. A needle is inserted into the amniotic sac through the woman's abdomen, and a small amount of fluid is removed. The fluid is then tested in a laboratory.
