A laparoscope is a long, thin tube with a light on the end. A surgeon inserts the laparoscope through a small cut in the patient's belly. The light on the end of the laparoscope helps the surgeon see the inside of the patient's belly. The surgeon uses the laparoscope to remove tissue from the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, or surrounding tissues.
