People can have different allergies to different things. For example, someone may be allergic to pollen from flowers, or to pet dander. Allergy shots are a way to help people who have allergies by injecting them with a small amount of the allergen. The goal is to help the person's body get used to the allergen, so that they will not have as many or as severe allergies symptoms when they are around the allergen.
