Hysteroscopy is looking inside the uterus through a telescope. This can be done for different reasons like finding out why you are having heavy periods or finding out why you are having trouble getting pregnant. Sterilization is when a woman can no longer have children. This can be done different ways but laparoscopic is when a small telescope is inserted through a small cut in the belly button.
