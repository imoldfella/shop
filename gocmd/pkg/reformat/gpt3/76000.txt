A chest x-ray is when a doctor or nurse takes a picture of your chest using a special machine. They usually do this to check if you have any problems with your lungs, heart, or other organs in your chest. A flouroscopy is a type of x-ray that takes a movie of your chest instead of just a picture. This can help the doctor or nurse see how your organs are working and if there are any problems.
