A complete blood cell count, or CBC, is a test that measures the cells that make up your blood. This includes red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The CBC can help to find problems with your blood, such as anemia or infection. The test also measures the level of a type of white blood cell called a lymphocyte. This can help to find out if you have an infection or a condition such as leukemia.
