The adenoids are a small lump of tissue located at the back of the nose, near the roof of the mouth. They are part of the lymphatic system, which helps to fight infection. The adenoids can become enlarged and cause problems with breathing, sleeping, and eating. When this happens, the adenoids can be removed surgically.
