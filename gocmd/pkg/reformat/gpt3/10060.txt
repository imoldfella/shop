When you have an infection, sometimes your body will create a pocket of pus to contain the infection. This is called an abscess. If the abscess is small and only has a little pus in it, your doctor can make a tiny cut and drain the pus out. If the abscess is bigger and has a lot of pus, your doctor will make a bigger cut and drain out all of the pus.
