The endoscope is a long, thin tube with a light and camera on the end of it. The doctor will put the endoscope through your child's mouth and into their stomach. The camera on the end of the endoscope will take pictures of the inside of your child's stomach. The doctor will use the brush to gently clean the inside of your child's stomach.
