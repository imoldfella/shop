A CT (computed tomography) scan of the neck is a special kind of X-ray that takes detailed pictures of the structures inside the neck. The CT scan is often done with dye, which is injected into the bloodstream through a small IV (intravenous) line in the arm. The dye helps the doctors to see the blood vessels in the neck more clearly.
